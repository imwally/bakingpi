Lesson 1 OK01

http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/ok01.html

The OK01 lesson contains an explanation about how to get started and teaches how
to enable the 'OK' or 'ACT' LED on the Raspberry Pi board near the RCA and USB
ports. This light was originally labelled OK but has been renamed to ACT on the
revision 2 Raspberry Pi boards.
